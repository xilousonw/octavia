    Now supports ``oslo_middleware http_proxy_to_wsgi``, which will set up the
    request URL correctly in the case that there is a proxy (for example, a
    loadbalancer such as HAProxy) in front of the Octavia API. It is off by
    default and can be enabled by setting ``enable_proxy_headers_parsing=True``
    in the ``[oslo_middleware]`` section of ``octavia.conf``.
