upgrade:
  - |
    Any amphorae running a py3 based image must be recycled or else they will
    eventually fail on certificate rotation.
fixes:
  - |
    Resolved broken certificate upload on py3 based amphora images. On a
    housekeeping certificate rotation event, the amphora would clear out its
    server certificate and return a 500, putting the amphora in ERROR status
    and breaking further communication. See upgrade notes.
