features:
  - |
    New Load Balancing algorithm SOURCE_IP_PORT has been added.
    It is supported only by OVN provider driver.
upgrade:
  - |
    All pools configured under OVN provider driver are
    automatically migrated to SOURCE_IP_PORT algorithm.
    Previously algorithm was named as ROUND_ROBIN, but in
    fact it was not working like ROUND_ROBIN. After
    investigating, it was observed that core OVN actually
    utilizes a 5 Tuple Hash/RSS Hash in DPDK/Kernel as a Load
    Balancing algorithm. The 5 Tuple Hash has Source IP, Destination
    IP, Protocol, Source Port, Destination Port.
    To reflect this the name was changed to SOURCE_IP_PORT.
