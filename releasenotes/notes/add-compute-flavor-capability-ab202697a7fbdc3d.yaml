    Operators can now use the 'compute_flavor' Octavia flavor capability when
    using the amphora provider driver. This allows custom compute driver
    flavors to be used per-load balancer. If this is not defined in an
    Octavia flavor, the amp_flavor_id Octavia configuration file setting
    will continue to be used.
