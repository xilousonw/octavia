    For the OpenStack Stein release, the Octavia team is excited to announce
    support for: Octavia flavors, TLS client authentication, backend
    re-encryption, and object tags.

    * Octavia flavors allow an operator to define "flavors" of load balancers,
      such as "active-standby" or "single" using the amphora driver, that
      configure the load balancer topology. The Amphora driver also supports
      specifying the nova compute flavor to use for the load balancer amphora.
    * TLS client authentication allows the listener to request a client
      certificate from users connecting to the load balancer. This certificate
      can then be checked against a CA certificate and optionally a certificate
      revocation list. New HTTP header insertions allow passing client
      certificate information to the backend members, while new L7 rules
      allow you to take custom actions based on the content of the client
      certificate.
    * Backend re-encryption allows users to configure pools to initiate TLS
      connections to the backend member servers. This enables load balancers
      to authenticate and encrypt connections from the load balancer to the
      backend member server.
    * Object tags allow users to assign a list of strings to the load balancer
      objects that can then be used for advanced API list filtering.
