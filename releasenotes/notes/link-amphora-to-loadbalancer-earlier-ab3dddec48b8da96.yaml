    Amphorae that are booting for a specific loadbalancer will now be linked to
    that loadbalancer immediately upon creation. Previously this would not
    happen until near the end of the process, leaving a gap during booting
    during which is was difficult to understand which booting amphora belonged
    to which loadbalancer. This was especially problematic when attempting to
    troubleshoot loadbalancers that entered ERROR status due to boot issues.
