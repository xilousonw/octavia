    The Stein release of Octavia introduces the octavia-lib python module.
    This library enables provider drivers to integrate easier with the Octavia
    API by providing a shared set of coding objects and interfaces.
upgrade:
  - |
    The Stein release of Octavia adds the driver-agent controller process.
    This process is deployed along with the Octavia API process and uses
    unix domain sockets for communication between the provider drivers using
    octavia-lib and the driver-agent.
    When upgrading to Stein, operators should make sure that the
    /var/run/octavia directry is available for the driver-agent with the
    appropriate ownership and permissions for the driver-agent and API
    processes to access it. The operator may need to make sure the driver-agent
    process starts after installation. For example, a systemd service may need
    to be created and enabled for it.
